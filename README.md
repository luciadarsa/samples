# C++ sample code comparison

## List implementations
The folder ListImplementations contains minimal list implementation in 4 different ways, for educational purposes:

1. ListSimpleCPP - very simple implementation of singly linked list, not generic.
2. ListClass - small improvement of ListSimpleCPP, class-based, doubly linked, still not generic.
3. ListCPPTemplate - generic implementation of doubly linked list, with templates. The intention is to show how ListSTL works (but in a simple way!), not to replace it.
4. ListSTL - basically an example using STL's list. 

All 4 implementations include test code based on the same functionality.
